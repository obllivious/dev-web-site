                <h1>COMMUNICATION AND TECHNOLOGY</h1>

                <br/>

                <p>In the different definitions found in the published literature on these terms, with particular reference to the proposed definition of UNESCO, we can highlight some relevant characteristics in each one:</p>
                   
                <li>Science - It is a set of organized knowledge; It develops through time; Part of mechanisms of causality of observable facts; It is based on the objective study of empirical phenomena; It is related to the proof of theories; It is associated with the publication of articles, theses, books, etc.; The created knowledge is freely transmitted and patrimony of civilization.</li>
                
                <br>
                
                <li>Society - It is constituted by a group of people; It develops through time; It is based on a system of relationships between people; Its members share purpose, interests, concerns and customs and interact with each other, constituting a community; Its members build knowledge and develop technology.</li>
                
                <br>
                
                <li>Technology - It is a set of scientific or empirical knowledge; It develops through time; It is based on the application of knowledge in the production or improvement of goods and services; It is related to socioeconomic impacts on a community; Its results are obtained from the application of new materials, processes, methods and products in the means of production; It is in tune with economic development and the well-being of society; Its products and processes can be negotiated and framed as patents.</li>

                <br>

                <h2>DIALECTICAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SOCIETY, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY</h2>

                <p>Despite the particular analysis of the terms society, science and technology, in the real world it is impossible to isolate these concepts, since they are intrinsically linked by a dialectical relationship. Dialectical Relation - From the Greek "day" (exchange) and "lekticós" (apt to the word) the term has the same root of dialogue. A dialectical relationship means a continuous reciprocal relationship, in which nothing can be understood in isolation, outside the reality around it, and without constant relations of mutual determination. All and all belong to a "dialectical totality" and are part of a structure. To better understand this dialectical relationship or retroaction between science, technology and society, we can take as an example the cellular telephone apparatus, so widespread today.</p>

                <li>Empiricism - Sensory Experience (John Locke).</li>
                <li>Positivism - Scientific knowledge as true knowledge.</li>

                <br/>

                <h2>Knowledge Society</h2>

                <li>Information technologies.</li>
                <li>Generation of knowledge as main activity.</li>
                <li>Notion of virtual space.</li>
                <li>Information and technology as a source of wealth.</li>
                <li>Globalized market.
                <li>Intensive development of hardware and software.</li>
                <li>It was about partnerships, interaction, and relationships.</li>
                <li>Internet and virtual reality, digital networks.</li>

                <br>

                <h2>TECHNOLOGICAL DETERMINISM</h2>

                <p>It can be defined as the Frankenstein effect, as if the technological system has become an entity, something independent and uncontrolled, an example of independence when the system goes off the air and we have no access, it has no external control. Technology can be good or bad. The Enlightenment was the first important movement that, at the same time and not by chance, questioned religious thinking and potentialized the idea of ​​neutrality. Positivism from the end of the eighteenth century, and based on the thought of Bacon and Descartes, contributed to reinforce the idea of ​​neutrality. Society is always in constant mutation and evolution and, until we reach the current period, we can clearly perceive four main phases of society's evolution.</p>

                <h2>ORGANIZATION FOR ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT (OECD)</h2>

                <p>The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is an international and intergovernmental organization that brings together the most industrialized countries in the market economy, based in Paris, France. Through the OECD, member country representatives come together to exchange information and define policies to maximize economic growth and development of these countries in the current Information and Knowledge Society.</p>
               
                <h2>NEUTRALITY</h2>

                <p>Companies want to wipe out neutrality and manipulate access to the internet by charging for speed and content. Poor countries do not have the proper access to the internet and rich countries have. An example is the provision of restrictive packages by operators, restricting access. Companies often want to charge additional services so that the user can have additional accesses. They are lousy and misleading services. The added advantages offered are an attack on neutrality.</p>

                <h2>PRODUCTIVE RESTRUCTURING AND SOCIETY</h2>

                <p>The concept of productive restructuring is related to: New way of organizing production made possible by information and communication technologies. In this new model, strategies are used to restructure productivity. One of them is the use of technology on labor relations; the other is the reduction of risks of using equipment with new working relationships in a more horizontal, less hierarchical way. See in the didactic material some examples that will facilitate your understanding.</p>

                <h2>BUSINESS CHAIN</h2>

                <p>Some companies adopted: The American model of Information Society, based on the companies to organize the business chain. In this model, business networks are based on large leading companies in partnership with universities for project development. The focus is on the customer and the products and services become suitable for him and his wishes. Innovation is the master spring in this model, where leading suppliers and companies team up in business chains to consolidate their position in the market.</p>

            <h2>Career Planning</h2>

            <p>University status allows you to have autonomy to perform its purposes, such as creating new courses, for example. The university centers, as well as the universities, have undergraduate courses in different areas of knowledge and autonomy to create courses at the institution's headquarters. They are usually smaller than a university and have no requirement to have stricto sensu programs, for example. Colleges usually work in specific areas of knowledge, specializing in management courses, for example, or health, education, etc.</p>

            <h2>Social Sciences</h2>
            
            <p>The notion of diversity has a long history in the configuration of the Social Sciences. Understanding the diversity of cultures is the central theme of Cultural Anthropology studies. It considers that societies should accept the diversity of cultures. However, what is observed is that humanity was for a long time blind to cultural and social differences and making objects of exclusion everything that was not part of its dominant ideologies.</p>

            <p>The concept of a Network Society has been widely disseminated through the works of Manuel Castells and can be understood as: "A society in which social structures and main activities are organized around electronically processed information networks."</p>

            <h2>The Green Paper and Cert.BR</h2>

            <p>Each society organized an Information Society proposal. In Brazil, the Green Paper was prepared, a document that aims to elucidate the objectives of the project and a political proposal, reflecting an offer of development of information technology and the Internet.</p>

            <p>Throughout history, each society has defined itself in a relation of contraposition in relation to other societies: 17th century at the time of the Renaissance the people of the forest were called natural or savage. 19th century. The term "primitive" meant tribal groups. What did not look like the European world should be considered inferior and backward. 2017,today, we call underdeveloped those who do not agree with the parameters of globalized neoliberal capitalism. Thus, talking about social diversity means highlighting the issue of the coexistence of different people and their differences in a context of tolerance and solidarity that can overcome violence, exclusionary hierarchies, perverse treatment, economic and social inequalities, among others.</p>
